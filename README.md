Hello everybody , thank you for visiting my project , this project is named STOOL which stands for "server tool" ,
 written with Python and a little use of Bash . 
This project has been written for beginners and medium people for using SSH , SCP protocols , and it is capable of information about your server such as: server status ,server location and log file (in Windows , Linux and Macos ) 

Log file address :

Windows : c:/stool/stool-log.txt

Unix : /home/yourusername/stool/stool-log.txt

We hope you have good time with this project 

TIp : if you use EXE format in windows, your Anti-virus will delete EXE file because STOOL make socket connection for checking internet and server status so you must turn off your Anti-virus on your windows.

The following libraries are used in this project :

1 - time

2 - os

3 - socket  

4 - sys

5 - datetime

6 - getpass

7 - json

8 - requests


You can install libraries with "pip install library-name"
